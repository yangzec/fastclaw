# Changelog

Notable changes to FastClaw. Items marked **BREAKING** require operator
action on upgrade — read those notes before deploying.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Cron jobs fired ~hours late on Postgres when the server ran in a
  non-UTC timezone.** The `cron_jobs` time columns were declared
  `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE`. A Go `time.Time` carrying a non-UTC
  offset (e.g. `Asia/Shanghai`) was written with its offset silently
  dropped, so a Beijing "09:00" job was stored as `09:00` and read back
  as `09:00 UTC` = `17:00 Beijing` — firing 8h late (or, in the opposite
  direction, never matching `next_run <= now()` at all). SQLite was
  unaffected. The columns are now `TIMESTAMPTZ`, which preserves the
  instant across write/read regardless of offset or session `TimeZone`.

### BREAKING — cron schedule state is reset on upgrade (Postgres only)

When a Postgres deployment runs the schema migration for the first time,
**every existing row in `cron_jobs` is deleted.** This is deliberate:
the stored `next_run` wall-clocks already carry the wrong timezone, so
converting them would freeze the bug into the new column type. A clean
reschedule is the correct recovery.

- **What is lost:** pending scheduled jobs (recurring `cron`, `interval`,
  and not-yet-fired `once` reminders).
- **What is NOT lost:** chat history (`sessions`, `session_messages`),
  agent identity files, provider/channel config — none of these are
  touched.
- **Operator action required:** after upgrading, any recurring schedule
  a user relies on (e.g. "every day at 9am") must be recreated by asking
  the agent again, or via the dashboard's Scheduler tab. The original
  `create_cron_job` tool calls are still visible in chat history and can
  serve as a reference for what to rebuild.
- **Visibility:** the gateway logs a single
  `level=WARN msg="resetting cron schedule state for timestamptz migration …"`
  line with the row count before wiping, so operators can tell from the
  upgrade log whether any jobs were affected.
- **SQLite deployments:** unaffected — the migration is skipped entirely.
- **Idempotent:** re-running the migration (e.g. on every daemon boot)
  is a no-op once the columns are already `timestamptz`.
