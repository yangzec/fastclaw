// hostCommandWaitDelay bounds how long Wait blocks on I/O *after* the
// process group has been signalled. Belt-and-suspenders behind the group
// kill: if some descendant escapes the group (a daemon that calls
// setsid, a process the shell disowned), the inherited pipe would
// otherwise keep CombinedOutput blocked indefinitely. With WaitDelay set
// Go abandons the copy and returns the bytes buffered so far.
const hostCommandWaitDelay = 5 * time.Second

// runHostCommand runs `sh -c command` on the host under a deadline that
// actually holds.
//
// The naive form — exec.CommandContext + CombinedOutput — silently fails
// to enforce its own timeout. CommandContext's default Cancel kills only
// the direct `sh` child; every grandchild survives, and because they
// inherited the write end of the pipe CombinedOutput reads from, Wait
// blocks until the LAST descendant exits. A `find / -name x | head`
// whose 120s deadline fires at t=120s therefore returned at t=18m30s,
// once find had finished walking the entire filesystem. The turn just
// hung, and the model got a bare `signal: killed` with no hint that a
// timeout was what killed it.
//
// Three things fix it, and all three are needed:
//
//  1. setProcessGroup — spawn `sh` as a group leader so the whole tree
//     is addressable. Same call bash_session.go already makes for
//     backgrounded shells (see TestShellManager_KillReachesGrandchildren).
//  2. cmd.Cancel — SIGKILL the group (kill(-pgid)) instead of the lone
//     `sh`, so the pipe writers actually die.
//  3. cmd.WaitDelay — cap the post-kill I/O wait for anything that
//     escaped the group.
//
// On timeout the error is rewritten into something actionable. `signal:
// killed` reads like a crash and sends the model looking for a bug in
// its command; "timed out after 120s" tells it to narrow the command or
// raise the timeout, which is the actual remedy.
