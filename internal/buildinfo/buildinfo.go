// IsHostedDeploy reports whether this fastclaw process is running in a
// hosted/multi-tenant deployment (cloud) versus a self-hosted single-
// operator install. Driven by the FASTCLAW_DEPLOY env var:
//
//	FASTCLAW_DEPLOY=hosted        → IsHostedDeploy() == true
//	FASTCLAW_DEPLOY=self-hosted   → false
//	(unset or anything else)      → false (default = self-hosted)
//
// Operators set this in their cloud deployment manifests (k8s
// values.yaml, docker-compose env, …). Default-self-hosted matches
// the most common case (developer running fastclaw on their own
// laptop) and avoids surprising upgrade prompts when an operator
// just forgets the env var on their cloud deploy — better to
// default to "tell the user how to upgrade" and only suppress when
// explicitly opted in.

// Read each call (not cached) so a config-edit + sighup flow can
// flip it without a process restart, though in practice it's set
// once at boot.

// infrastructure and chatters are strangers, so nothing may touch it.
// Self-hosted installs default to NOT enforced — the operator's own
// machine is the natural execution environment ("install ffmpeg for me"
// must work on the host), and the sandbox exists to provide an isolated,
// pre-provisioned toolbox (python, node, camoufox-cli, …), not to wall
// the operator out of their own laptop.
//
